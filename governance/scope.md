# Scope

## Mission

Standardize engineering foundation across multiple repositories without monorepo lock-in.

## Boundaries

ASDEV Platform can:
- Define governance artifacts
- Publish language-agnostic and language-aware standards
- Provide reusable templates and sync tooling
- Report divergence
- Govern repositories with approved runtime external dependencies via explicit policy

ASDEV Platform cannot:
- Override repository owner merge authority
- Own or modify product behavior decisions in consumer repositories
- Impose external SaaS lock-in as a requirement

## Enforcement Model

- PR-driven adoption
- Advisory-first rollout
- Optional merge by repository owner
- Divergence is measured and reported
- External dependency exceptions must be explicitly documented and reviewed
