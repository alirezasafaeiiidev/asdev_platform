# Governance Update: Phase J Execution (2026-02-10)

## Summary

- Phase J self-healing rollout was implemented and then reverted by policy decision.
- Repository baseline keeps CI recovery manual/on-demand (no 5-minute global self-healing workflow).
- Validation remained green after rollback and follow-up hardening.

## Artifacts

- `docs/phase-j-execution-plan.md`

## Rollback Note

- Auto-recovery artifacts were intentionally removed from repository defaults.
